/*

 1) Do Hsv to Rgb and vice versa
 2) Migrate tri and quad pixel to vector?
 3) Do matrix based color model converters
 4) Write color model pixelconv for all models which use matrix multiplication
 5) Change pixel to color for colormodel stuff?
 6) Create color convert functions (and call them from the pixel convert code?)
 7) Make UnitInterval class instead of float... should do a mod 1 on assignment operator
 8) Change colormap stuff to use vector3
 9) Rename colormap linearcolormap?
10) Maybe make a unit interval wrapper class that could be put around a basic data float variable
